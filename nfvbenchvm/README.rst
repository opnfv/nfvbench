NFVBENCH VM IMAGE FOR OPENSTACK 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This repo will build a centos 7 image with testpmd and VPP installed.
The VM will come with a pre-canned user/password: nfvbench/nfvbench

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Pre-requisites
--------------
- must run on Linux
- the following packages must be installed prior to using this script:
    - git
    - qemu-utils
    - kpartx

Build the image
---------------
- cd dib
- update the version number for the image (if needed) by modifying __version__ in build-image.sh 
- setup your http_proxy if needed
- bash build-image.sh

IMAGE INSTANCE AND CONFIG
=========================

Interface Requirements
----------------------
The instance must be launched using OpenStack with 2 network interfaces.
For best performance, it should use a flavor with:

- 2 vCPU
- 4 GB RAM
- cpu pinning set to exclusive

Auto-configuration
------------------
nfvbench VM will automatically find the two virtual interfaces to use, and use the forwarder specifed in the config file.

In the case testpmd is used, testpmd will be launched with mac forwarding mode where the destination macs rewritten according to the config file.

In the case VPP is used, VPP will set up a L3 router, and forwarding traffic from one port to the other.

nfvbenchvm Config
-----------------
nfvbenchvm config file is located at ``/etc/nfvbenchvm.conf``.

.. code-block:: bash

    FORWARDER=VPP
    TG_MAC0=00:10:94:00:0A:00
    TG_MAC1=00:11:94:00:0A:00
    VNF1_GATEWAY_CIDR=1.1.0.2/8
    VNF2_GATEWAY_CIDR=2.2.0.2/8
    TG1_NET=10.0.0.0/8
    TG2_NET=20.0.0.0/8
    TG1_GATEWAY_IP=1.1.0.100
    TG1_GATEWAY_IP=2.2.0.100


Launching nfvbenchvm VM
-----------------------

Normally this image will be used together with NFVBench, and the required configurations will be automatically generated and pushed to VM by NFVBench. If launched manually, no forwarder will be run. Users will have the full control to run either testpmd or VPP via VNC console.

To check if testpmd is running, you can run this command in VNC console:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo screen -r testpmd

To check if VPP is running, you can run this command in VNC console:

.. code-block:: bash

    service vpp status


Hardcoded Username and Password
--------------------------------
- Username: nfvbench 
- Password: nfvbench
