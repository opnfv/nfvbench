      "message": "clarify here if it is one floating IP per VM and per chain, and in the case of PVVP is it 2 floating IP per chain (I assume yes)\n\nthe only drawback of floating ip is that people usually have very small pool and it is therefore not usable to use floating IP with large number of chains.\nOne potential enhancement is to allow floating IP only on the first chain since in most cases this is useful to debug what is going on in the VM (can be done later if needed).\nHere must state that the user must have sufficient floating IP as there is one or 2 needed per chain.",

      "message": "both variables can be empty in case of management port disabled, so this should not be logged as an error.\nAnother potential issue is that here you assume the mgmt port is always eth0 bug this is not guaranteed. For ex if you create 3 ports with openstack APIs, the firsty one is not necessarily mapped to eth0, so we may have for ex:\nport0 -\u003e eth1\nport1 -\u003e eth0\nport3 -\u003e eth2\nThe only way to be sure is to match on the MAC address (ie nfvbench will note down the MAC for each port and note it in the vmconfig which MAC corresponds to which logical port).\nThat is why we have INTF_MAC1 and INTF_MAC2 so we know exactly which VM port corresponds to which neutron port.",
