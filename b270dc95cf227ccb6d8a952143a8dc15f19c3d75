      "message": "ok you assume nova will place the second vm on another host - if load balancing allows it. So there is just one case where inter-node could have been satisfied when load balancing is not favorable (e.g. node A has 0 VM, node B has 1 VM, running PVVP inter-node will place the second VM on A even though it should have been B)\n\nThe only good way to handle this properly is to use node anti-affinity for the second VM.\n\nBut since this code is being rewritten we\u0027ll just make it simple here an dhave a small caveat.",
